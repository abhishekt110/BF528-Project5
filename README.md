## data_normalization_QC.R -- R script to pre-process and normalize all Affymetrix chip data from Marisa et al. through the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) method. Quality controls such as relative log expression (RLE) and normalized unscaled standard errors (NUSE) were performed. Batch effects were corrected using the ComBat algorithm. Resulting data was plotted on principal component analysis (PCA).
